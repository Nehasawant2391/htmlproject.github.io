   <h1>Information About the Library</h1>
    <p>Libraries provide a unique opportunity to explore and learn from different cultures around the world. Libraries often have special collections, such as rare books, documents, and artifacts. Libraries are great places to discover new hobbies or interests.
        A little reading is all the therapy which a person needs sometimes and no one can possibly feel alone in a room full of books. Thus, libraries are a magical place filled with centuries of stories, fiction, and reality to feed your quenching thirst for all the times to come. So if you are a bibliophile like us and are always on the hunt for good books, these Libraries in Bangalore will fulfill all your needs at a very minimal cost.
        Although the development of digital libraries means that people do not have to go to a building for some kinds of information, users still need help to locate the information they want. In a traditional library building, a user has access to a catalog that will help locate a book. In a digital library, a user has access to catalogs to find traditional library materials, but much of the information on, for example, the Internet can not be found through one commonly accepted form of identification. This problem necessitates agreement on standard ways to identify pieces of electronic information (sometimes called meta-data) and the development of codes (such as HTML [Hypertext Markup Language] and SGML [Standard Generalized Markup Language]) that can be inserted into electronic texts.
